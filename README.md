# find-cheapest-operator (alatest challenge)
This is a simple program to find the Cheapest Operator using AngularJS. 
I have Kept everything as simple as I can, The index.html file is having the Main code
and along with that you will find two json files where I have created price list of respective operators A and B.
So, after you submit the phone number you will get the output as displayed in the output-screenshot.
I have also uploaded my CV along with the cover letter in pdf file as asked.
If you expected something else let me know. Hope to hear from you soon and Thank you.
